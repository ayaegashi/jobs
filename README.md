## How to run locally

### Step 1 [with git]: Clone this Github repository to your local computer
Note: this step requires that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).<br />
Open up your terminal and `cd` into the local directory where you would like to open this project. Once in a local directory, run:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ayaegashi/jobs.git
```

Change directories into the project directory:
```sh
$ cd jobs
```

### Step 1 [without git]: Download Github repository to local computer
Click the green Code button at the top right of the screen and select "Download ZIP".
Open up your terminal and `cd` into the downloaded directory. (This directory should be called "jobs-main"):
```sh
$ cd jobs-main
```

### Step 2: Install necessary packages
For this step and the next step, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
```sh
$ npm install
```
